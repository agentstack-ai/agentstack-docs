## Description

This tools is a wrapper around the composio set of tools and gives your agent access to a wide variety of tools from the Composio SDK.

## Example

Add the Composio tool with
```bash
agentstack tools add composio
````

The following example demonstrates how to initialize the tool and execute a github action:

```python Code
from crewai_tools import ComposioTool

composio_tools = [ComposioTool.from_action(action=Action.GITHUB_ACTIVITY_STAR_REPO_FOR_AUTHENTICATED_USER)]
```

<Note>Its important that `composio_tools` is a list, even if only one element</Note>

If you don't know what action you want to use, use `from_app` and `tags` filter to get relevant actions

```python Code
from crewai_tools import ComposioTool
from composio import App

composio_tools = ComposioTool.from_app(App.GITHUB, tags=["important"])
```

or use `use_case` to search relevant actions

```python Code
composio_tools = ComposioTool.from_app(App.GITHUB, use_case="Star a github repository")
```
