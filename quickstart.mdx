## Initialize a new project

AgentStack's greatest ability is that of quickly scaffolding agent projects

### Wizard

AgentStack v0.1 supports a friendly setup wizard!

To start, ensure you have AgentStack [installed](/installation) and run:
```bash
agentstack init
```

<Note>Using the wizard is recommended in AgentStack version 0.1 (current release)</Note>


### Without Wizard

Starting a project without the wizard is useful if you are past the ideation stage and want to just start with a default project template:
```bash
agentstack init --no-wizard
```

## Building your project

By default, your project will contain no agents or tasks.

AgentStack is built on top of [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction)
